hello world
we switch from *blosxom.pl* to *wlog.py*, v0.1. It is a dynamic CGI
python3 script that displays blogs from flatfile Markdown textfiles.

The road ahead is bumpy. Static file generation is a priority. In
fact, so is markdown and flatfile databases.

wlog may operate imperfectly during development. YGWYPF.

date and title from metadata, post indexing, pagination,
themeing, subdirectory support, pagination and indexing of 
subdirectories,
